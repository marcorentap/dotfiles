# Overview
My setup scripts designed for working through SSH so no fancy themes or fonts, no terminal setup.

Note 20230505: There are problems with radare2 builds.

# Usage
**Warning!** Existing configs will get overwritten since the scripts won't create backups yet. Best used on fresh installs.

To use default config (requires sudo):

```
make
```

To use inuiyeji config:

```
make inuiyeji
```
